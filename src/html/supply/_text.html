    How do supply chain attacks work?
  </h2>

  <p class="text">
    Supply chain attacks are multi-staged attacks leveraging a variety of attack techniques to reach desired goals. By indirectly infiltrating supply chain vendors, bad actors seek to gain access to the networks of their end-users or customers. Two varieties of a supply chain attack are:

      Method 1: Partner Network Access
    </h3>

    <p class="text">
      In this supply chain attack, bad actors gain access to a partner network, such as a managed service provider (MSP), to then gain access to the MSP’s clients’ networks. For example, in the 2013 Target breach, bad actor’s initially gained access to Target’s HVAC partner’s network. This network is used to monitor the HVAC systems at Target stores. By gaining access to this less secure partner network, the bad actors were able to find their way to the Point-of-Sale (POS) networks to install RAM scraping software on POS units to steal credit card information.

      Method 2: Embedded Malware
    </h3>

    <p class="text">
      In this supply chain attack, bad actors infiltrate supply chain vendors to discover source code repositories or update systems to inject their own malicious software. In today’s networking environments, both software applications and hardware appliances regularly ‘phone home’ to retrieve and perform updates. Often these updates are automated. It is not uncommon for upgrades to fetch data for other libraries, including third-party sources. Often upgrades run with root or administrator privileges, and execute a variety of scripts throughout the update process.

    <p class="text">
      For example, in the SolarWinds breach, bad actors successfully added a malicious DLL (Microsoft Data Link Library) file to a SolarWinds update. Once installed on a customer’s system and activated after a random wait period, the DLL performs command-and-control, retrieving and executing commands from a third party system managed by the Bad Actor.
