    What is the Spyderbat Platform?
  </h2>

  <p class="text">
    Fast moving workloads, multiple layers of virtualization, and accessible to multiple user groups: Identifying issues
    and getting to the root cause is nearly impossible in modern Linux environments. Spyderbat secures your Linux
    runtime environment by tracing user sessions, network connections, processes, and file access by causal
    relationships.
