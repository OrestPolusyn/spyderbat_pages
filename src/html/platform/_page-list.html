  What is the Spyderbat Platform?
</h2>

<p class="platform-page__text text">
  Fast moving workloads, multiple layers of virtualization, and accessible to multiple user groups: Identifying issues and getting to the root cause is nearly impossible in modern Linux environments. Spyderbat secures your Linux runtime environment by tracing user sessions, network connections, processes, and file access by causal relationships.
