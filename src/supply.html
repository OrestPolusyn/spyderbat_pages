            Spyderbat captures the causal relationships across every process, network connection, and file access performed by the update
          </h2>

          <p class="text">
            Once attack techniques are detected, Spyderbat allows for an immediate recognition of the source back to the third-party update even if months prior. The attackâ€™s full footprint is revealed since any/all activity between the previous software update and the current detection is captured, even if the bad actor/malware uses random weight periods in between activities.
          </p>

          <p class="text">
            Because Spyderbat does not rely on log data analysis, the attack trace is captured even if logging systems were disabled (or never enabled to begin with). This allows for full mitigation of the threat including new installed backdoors, created user accounts, etc.
