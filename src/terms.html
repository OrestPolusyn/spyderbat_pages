                    https://www.spyderbat.com/<br>privacy</a> 
                  (the “Privacy Policy”), and any Additional Terms (defined below),
                  are the entire and exclusive understanding and agreement between you and Spyderbat regarding your use
                  of the Site and the Community Software. You may not assign or transfer these Terms or your rights
                  under these Terms, in whole or in part, by operation of law or otherwise, without our prior written
                  consent. We may assign these Terms at any time without notice or consent. The failure to require
                  performance of any provision will not affect our right to require performance at any other time after
                  that, nor will a waiver by us of any breach or default of these Terms, or any provision of these
                  Terms, be a waiver of any subsequent breach or default or a waiver of the provision itself. Use of
                  section headers in these Terms is for convenience only and will not have any impact on the
                  interpretation of any provision. Throughout these Terms the use of the word “including” means
                  “including but not limited to”. If any part of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable, the
                  unenforceable part will be given effect to the greatest extent possible, and the remaining parts will
                  remain in full force and effect.
                </li>

                <li>
                  Governing Law. These Terms are governed by the laws of the State of Texas without regard to conflict
                  of law
                  principles that would result in the application of the laws of another jurisdiction. You and Spyderbat
                  submit to the
                  personal and exclusive jurisdiction of the state courts and federal courts located within Travis
